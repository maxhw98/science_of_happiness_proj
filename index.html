  <p>Welcome message:</p>
  
  
  <p>Welcome to Positive Student Strategies! This is a compiled resource page for strategies to handle stress for students, all based on the science of positive psychology. We hope that the information and strategies outlined here will help in making your student experience a great one! </p>
  
  <p>Sleep & Nutrition:</p>
  
  The mind and body are not separate! Your physical health is an important part of your mental health as well. Many students have been told that maintaining a proper sleep schedule and nutrition are essential to their health and performance in school. However, school itself can cause usual sleep and eating cycles to become chaotic and irregular, which contributes to a negative downhill spiral. Below are some resources for restoring and maintaining one’s sleep and eating cycles.

  Meditation:
  
  Meditation is a well known coping mechanism for stress and anxiety that has been used for hundreds of years. Though the popular notion of mediation is limited to closing your eyes and sitting very still, there are actually many different forms of meditation that one can use. An example of a more active meditation technique is tensing up and releasing different parts of the body, starting from the head and moving down to the feet. A grounding meditation technique can even be as simple as going for a walk while keeping a certain color in mind and noting each time it appears. 
  
  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Exercises:
  
  Do you find yourself going through the same patterns of negative thoughts and behaviors over and over again? One bad grade might not ruin your semester, but a pattern of catastrophizing will only serve to increase your stress. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one way psychologists tackle negative thought patterns. It’s based on the CBT model of emotion, where emotions are broken down into thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. For example, one might have a thought that studying for the exam is pointless because they haven’t covered enough of the material beforehand. This leads to a feeling of hopelessness that can lead to a behavior of not studying at all that day, which then can lead to the thought, “Oh no, I have so much left to study!” Then comes the feeling of hopelessness, and the cycle continues. The theory is that if you can make a change in one of these three parts of the cycle, the rest will change as well. These exercises are not a replacement for a mental health professional, however, they can be hugely helpful in understanding the causes of your stress and how to respond to them.

  Organizational Techniques and Tools:
  
  Organizing your work is one step that can greatly reduce your stress when dealing with large projects or assignments. Organization is not one size fits all, so we’ve included a myriad of methodologies here, ranging from time management to learning strategies. Divide and conquer! 
  
  Anxiety and Stress Management:
  
  College is already a stressful enough experience. Add a pandemic on top of that, and it can be completely overwhelming. The links below provide aid in managing day to day stress and anxiety. Again, these are not replacements for the work of a mental health professional.
